XWiki Invitation Application
-------------------------------------------

Works on XWiki 2.4M1
XWiki Syntax: 2.0

This application creates a document called XWiki.InvitationMessages the first time it runs. You may
configure this to be a different file by navigating to the invitation section of the administration
interface and setting the field "Document containing email XObjects".

Allows users to invite friends to join the wiki. Allows administrators to multiple people at once.
Administrators can define a template which augments the users' email message and subject line.
All messages are stored locally as well as sent.
If recipients of email feel that it is spam then they can click a unique link which will set a spam
flag on the email and the user who sent it will be unable to send more email until an administrator
marks the email as having been investigated.

NOTE:
In order to run this in it's current form you must refer to the XWiki.InvitationLanguagePack in
the XWikiPreferences language packs field. To do this navigate to the administration interface for the
wiki and click on the "Programming" section. In the field labeled "Internationalization Document Bundles"
add "XWiki.InvitationLanguagePack".
