*Updated Renderer, for new xwiki-core-rendering
*Created TestRenderer
*Included xwiki-core-rendering-macro-velocity, but NOT Working
*Changed libs for getPageSummaryAtIndex(), function rename

* Updated, since Renderer depends on xwiki-core-rendering-api
* Delete on a Large Wiki now uses IProgressMonitor

* Updated log
* Tested Lazy Retrieval functionality for Spaces. Working fine.
* Updated CreateLargeWiki for Testing.

* "New space" Creation for XEclipse

* Extended 6th Objective and included DataManager's expansion also
* Above functionality NOT tested, because xwiki server was not initializing properly [Some Context/internal error]
* DND between 2 different DataManagers would not give error.
* Updated Log
* Updated Libs

Working fine. Implemented Feature Lazy Retrieval of Pages
* Retrieves pages in batches, if number of pages > 100, without obstructing the UI functionality
* No blockage
* Pending message displayed as the bottom node.
* Removed all Trace messages
* Cleaned up.
* Objective 6's first working/implemented commit.

Commit for communication purpose

* Modified xmlrpc libs a bit for correct functioning of getPages() function
* Easier Tracing
* NOT working as expected (the same error as the previous commit)

* Created Initial Lazy Retrieval-Type Viewer
* Uses getPages(space,start,limit) and getNumberofPages xmlrpc methods to retrieve pages in batches.
* Loosely based on J2EEContentProvider of org.eclipse.jst.j2ee.navigator.ui according to http://dev.eclipse.org/newslists/news.eclipse.platform/msg54809.html
* NOT Working as expected.

Commit for communication Purposes.
* http://www.eclipse.org/newsportal/article.php?id=37027&group=eclipse.platform.rcp#37027
* Overriden method in XWikiEclipseNavigator for SWT.VIRTUAL
* Implemented updateChildCount() and updateElement() but, that does not seem to be called.
* Does plugin.xml have to be changed for it to be activated?
* Another newsgroup mail in this direction http://dev.eclipse.org/newslists/news.eclipse.platform/msg54562.html
* Updated xwiki-core and xwiki-xmlrpc-* libs for getPage(spacename,index) method and getPage(spacename,start,limit) method, for future possible use in lazy tree.

Changed:-
* ATTACHMENT_COPIED Bug Removed
* copyPage() works. New xmlrpc patched libs, and xwiki-1559 also updated.
* Scroll position saved and restored.
* PagePreview Rendering was broken earlier. Was fixed.
* Log file added.
* Updated README

Minor Commit
* Notification triggers for DND
* Completed some FIXME's.
* copyPage's xmlrpc still NOT corrected
* ATTACHMENT_RENAMED is not perfect, should not do a viewer.refresh.
* ATTACHMENT_COPIED bug exists.

Added:-
* Improved Drag and Drop Support, Error Handling
* Status Bar, setStatusMessage() from any point, can be used further for removing other possibly annoying message dialogs.
* Drop to Editor Area. Drag Pages/Attachments/Objects from CNF to Editor area, and open appropriately.
* Better renamePage implementation that uses updated xmlrpc function.
* Patched xwiki-xmlrpc-client, there was a small error because I used attachment.getId() and not attachment.getParentId() in the patch submitted.

TBD:-
* Notification triggers http://gsoc.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XEclipse/DragDrop End of Point 1),2)
* copyPage is erroneous. because the xmlrpc implementation is incorrect. doc.getDocument().copyDocument(newpageId,xwikiContext) does not do the job correctly.
* xmlrpc tests.

* Basic Drag and Drop Support. Incomplete. Buggy.
* Updated README for explaining howto use DND with patched JARS.

Works with patch_XWIKI-1559.patch:- http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-1559

* Rename Attachment
* Move Attachment to another Page+Space.
* NOT Fully Tested, esp. will have to see if attachment History is actually being saved.
* Uses New XMLRPC Functions created in patch.
* Newer xmlrpc-client/model Libs, created using patch.

Very Minor commit.

* Updated README to run the code.
* 1 bug, fixed.
* Dependency updated, copy-dependencies.

* State Persistence of Open Editors, i.e restores State of Editors across sessions.
* EditorHistory now saved.
* Major Refactoring of code, XWikiEclipseNavigator.java, more developer-friendly to read code.

* State Persistence across sessions (For the CNF)
	* Saves object names of expanded elements to workbench.xml
	* Restores  and creates objects correspondingly from it on startup.
	* Uses Eduard Moraru's code that waits for the data manager to get expanded, and then expands the space summary, followed by page summary.

* Small Change in PagePreview, for handling NullPointerExceptions in Pages which have not been opened.
* saveState (Persistence) of CNF. restoreState implemented, but giving exception since DM is not yet initiated.

Updated, better Local Rendering Support.
A Bit Buggy version.

Added missing dependencies.
Ignored lib directory which is automatically generated by copying dependencies.

Removed jars and added a script for copying dependencies using Maven dependency plugin.
