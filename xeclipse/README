This is a "work in progress" project, developed as a Google Summer of Code 2009 project.

To Run from Eclipse:-
* Import the projects contained in this folder separately.
* In command line, Run org.xwiki.eclipse.ui->copy-dependencies.sh to download required jars (Maven Script)
* Clean+Build All Projects (There should be no errors in Eclipse PDE (Red Error symbols :-) ) )
* Run org.xwiki.eclipse.product [org.xwiki.eclipse.rcp->org.xwiki.eclipse.product->Run As->Eclipse Application] as an Eclipse application.
* To test Drag and Drop and some other functionalities, You need patched lib jar files for the server side (New XMLRPC Functions). You can either apply
  the latest patch given in JIRA XWIKI-1559 and generate JAR files, or use the patched jar files already saved in org.xwiki.eclipse.ui->tempPatchedLibs.
  Copy the 2 JAR Files to (say) xwiki-enterprise-jetty-hsqldb-2.0/webapps/xwiki/WEB-INF/lib/ and use xeclipse to connect to this xwiki server.
  
What all implemented/done:-
Pretty much `svn log http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/sandbox/gsoc/xeclipse` and http://gsoc.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XEclipse/ 

Bugs/FIXME's That I know exist:-
* if setExpandedState of spaceSummary Fails, then endless loop for expanding pageSummary. Big Bug. "page Summary waiting..." at console.
* Rendering switch action not the smoothest.
* Better, smoother implementation of ATTACHMENT_RENAMED
* LocalXWikiDataStorage Integration?
* addMergedDropListener Error
