Sentences in English are made of...
* A [[English/Parts of the Sentence/Subjects|subject]] - the person, place, thing or idea the sentence is about
* And a [[English/Parts of the Sentence/Predicates|predicate]] - a [[wikt:word|word]] or [[wikt:phrase|phrase]] that tells about the subject.

In a sentence, the subject is first. The subject must be a [[wikt:noun|noun]] (a [[wikt:person|person]], [[wikt:place|place]], [[wikt:thing|thing]], or [[wikt:idea|idea]]), a [[wiktionary:pronoun|pronoun]] (a word that replaces a noun), or a phrase that describes one of those.  The subject is what the sentence is about.

After the subject comes the predicate.  The predicate is the rest of the sentence.  The predicate tells what the subject is or does.  It almost always begins with a [[English/Parts of Speech/Verbs|verb]] (an [[wikt:action|action]] or [[wikt:state of being|state of being]]).  It can be a verb alone.  When there is more than one verb in a sentence, we call the one at the beginning of the predicate the '''main verb'''.
*For example: ''He eats''.
:*&quot;he&quot; is the subject.
:*&quot;eats&quot; is the predicate.  
:*&quot;He&quot; is a pronoun.  
:*&quot;Eats&quot; is a verb. It tells what the subject (he) does.

Sentences often also include an [[English/Parts of the Sentence/Objects|object]] - a noun or phrase that the verb does something to.
*For example: ''He eats food''.
:*&quot;he&quot; is the subject.
:*&quot;eat food&quot; is the predicate.  
:*&quot;Eat&quot; is the verb, that tells what &quot;he&quot; does.  It is the first part of the predicate.  
:*&quot;Food&quot; is the rest of the predicate.  &quot;Food&quot; is a noun, the [[wikt:direct object|direct object]] of the verb.  
:*&quot;Food&quot; receives the action â€” food gets eaten.  
:*&quot;He&quot; (the subject) &quot;eats&quot; (the action) &quot;food&quot; (the direct object).

'''Complex sentences''' are sentences that usually contain multiple subjects and predicates connected by a subordinator such as ''after, although, as, as if, because, before, if, since, though, unless, when, where, whether, whereas, while'' and others. These sentences have an independent clause and [[a dependent clause]].  This is the first type of complex sentence containing an adverbial clause, a clause modifying the verb/action.
 
1. [[''When'' he tripped on the ice]]''',''' he dropped all his books and lost his homework.

2. The teacher lectured him [[''before'' she knew the reason why it was missing]]. 

3. The student explained the accident [[''because'' he was worried about his grade]].

4. [[''After'' he had explained the incident]]''',''' the teacher had mercy. 

'''Commas''' are used when the sentence starts with the dependent clause (e.g. sentence 1 and 4).  
No commas are necessary when the dependent clauses comes in the middle or end of the sentence (e.g. sentence 2 and 3).

There is another type of complex sentence in which the noun is being modified by [[an adjectival clause or relative clause]]. These complex sentences still contain multiple subjects and predicates which start with a subordinator such as ''which, that, who or whom'' just to name a few. 
 
A. The dog''',''' [[''which'' my brother petted on the way to school]]''',''' bit him.

B. The desk [[''that'' Peter sat on and fell]] is broken.

C. The box''',''' [[''which'' Samuel dragged into his backyard]]''',''' turned out to be full of toys.

D. The town [[''in which'' I live]] suffered from severe forest fires.
 
The comma rule is more subjective for relative clauses.  If the information in the clause is necessary for the information in the sentence, then the clause is set off by commas.  If the clause is not necessary for the sentence, then the cluase is surrounded by commas.

'''Parts of speech''' are ways to [[wikt:categorize|categorize]] words.  The category tells what the word does.  A [[English/Parts of Speech/Nouns|noun]], for example, names a person, a place, a thing, or an idea.  Here is a list of the parts of speech:
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Nouns|noun]]
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Verbs|verb]]
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Adjectives|adjective]]
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Adverbs|adverb]]
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Pronouns|pronoun]]
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Prepositions|preposition]]
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Conjunctions|conjunction]]
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Interjections|interjection]]

Another type of word that people often think of separately is the [[English/Parts of Speech/Articles|article]], but it is really a special kind of adjective.
