Sentences in English are made of...
* A [[English/Parts of the Sentence/Subjects|subject]] - the person, place, thing or idea the sentence is about
* And a [[English/Parts of the Sentence/Predicates|predicate]] - a [[wikt:word|word]] or [[wikt:phrase|phrase]] that tells about the subject.

In a sentence, the subject is first. The subject must be a [[wikt:noun|noun]] (a [[wikt:person|person]], [[wikt:place|place]], [[wikt:thing|thing]], or [[wikt:idea|idea]]), a [[wiktionary:pronoun|pronoun]] (a word that replaces a noun), or a phrase that describes one of those.  The subject is what the sentence is about.

After the subject comes the predicate.  The predicate is the rest of the sentence.  The predicate tells what the subject is or does.  It almost always begins with a [[English/Parts of Speech/Verbs|verb]] (an [[wikt:action|action]] or [[wikt:state of being|state of being]]).  It can be a verb alone.  When there is more than one verb in a sentence, we call the one at the beginning of the predicate the '''main verb'''.
*For example: ''He eats''.
:*&quot;he&quot; is the subject.
:*&quot;eats&quot; is the predicate.  
:*&quot;He&quot; is a pronoun.  
:*&quot;Eats&quot; is a verb. It tells what the subject (he) does.

Sentences often also include an [[English/Parts of the Sentence/Objects|object]] - a noun or phrase that the verb does something to.
*For example: ''He eats food''.
:*&quot;he&quot; is the subject.
:*&quot;eat food&quot; is the predicate.  
:*&quot;Eat&quot; is the verb, that tells what &quot;he&quot; does.  It is the first part of the predicate.  
:*&quot;Food&quot; is the rest of the predicate.  &quot;Food&quot; is a noun, the [[wikt:direct object|direct object]] of the verb.  
:*&quot;Food&quot; receives the action — food gets eaten.  
:*&quot;He&quot; (the subject) &quot;eats&quot; (the action) &quot;food&quot; (the direct object).

'''Complex sentences''' are sentences that usually contain multiple subjects and predicates connected by a subordinator such as ''after, although, as, as if, because, before, if, since, though, unless, when, where, whether, whereas, while'' and others. These sentences have an independent clause and [[a dependent clause]].  This is the first type of complex sentence containing an adverbial clause, a clause modifying the verb/action.
 
1. [[''When'' he tripped on the ice]]''',''' he dropped all his books and lost his homework.

2. The teacher lectured him [[''before'' she knew the reason why it was missing]]. 

3. The student explained the accident [[''because'' he was worried about his grade]].

4. [[''After'' he had explained the incident]]''',''' the teacher had mercy. 

'''Commas''' are used when the sentence starts with the dependent clause (e.g. sentence 1 and 4).  
No commas are necessary when the dependent clauses comes in the middle or end of the sentence (e.g. sentence 2 and 3).

There is another type of complex sentence in which the noun is being modified by [[an adjectival clause or relative clause]]. These complex sentences still contain multiple subjects and predicates which start with a subordinator such as ''which, that, who or whom'' just to name a few. 
 
A. The dog''',''' [[''which'' my brother petted on the way to school]]''',''' bit him.

B. The desk [[''that'' Peter sat on and fell]] is broken.

C. The box''',''' [[''which'' Samuel dragged into his backyard]]''',''' turned out to be full of toys.

D. The town [[''in which'' I live]] suffered from severe forest fires.
 
The comma rule is more subjective for relative clauses.  If the information in the clause is necessary for the information in the sentence, then the clause is set off by commas.  If the clause is not necessary for the sentence, then the cluase is surrounded by commas.

'''Parts of speech''' are ways to [[wikt:categorize|categorize]] words.  The category tells what the word does.  A [[English/Parts of Speech/Nouns|noun]], for example, names a person, a place, a thing, or an idea.  Here is a list of the parts of speech:
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Nouns|noun]]
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Verbs|verb]]
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Adjectives|adjective]]
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Adverbs|adverb]]
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Pronouns|pronoun]]
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Prepositions|preposition]]
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Conjunctions|conjunction]]
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Interjections|interjection]]

Another type of word that people often think of separately is the [[English/Parts of Speech/Articles|article]], but it is really a special kind of adjective.

A '''noun''' is a part of speech.  It names or [[wikt:identify|identifies]] four things:

*people
*places
*things
*ideas

Nouns can be categorized in many ways.
*They may be singular (like &quot;son&quot;) or plural (like &quot;sons&quot;).  This is called [[English/Parts of Speech/Nouns/Number|number]].
*They may be common (like &quot;house&quot;) or proper (like &quot;Thomas House&quot;).  All nouns that are not [[English/Parts of Speech/Nouns/Proper Nouns|proper]] are common.
*They may be concrete (like &quot;street&quot;) or abstract (like &quot;love&quot;).  All nouns that are not concrete are [[English/Parts of Speech/Nouns/Abstract Nouns|abstract]].
*They may be count (like &quot;piece&quot;), non-count or mass (like &quot;information&quot;) or collective (like &quot;group&quot;).  This is called [[English/Parts of Speech/Nouns/Countability|countability]].
*Some nouns may be masculine (like &quot;postman&quot;) or feminine (like &quot;stewardess&quot;), but most nouns do not have [[wikt:gender|gender]].  Nouns that are masculine or feminine are said to have [[English/Parts of Speech/Nouns/Gender|noun gender]].

You may learn about these aspects of nouns or go to the next section about [[English/Parts of Speech/Verbs|verbs]].

'''Countability''' is a very important idea about nouns.  Some other ideas depend on countability.  

*'''Count nouns''' are things that can be counted, like spoons, boys, and houses. 
**We can say one spoon, two boys, and three houses.
*'''Non-count nouns''' are things that can not be counted, but they can be measured.
** We say: &quot;a cup of milk&quot;, but not &quot;3 milks&quot;.
** We say: &quot;a pound of sugar&quot;, but not &quot;25 sugars&quot;.
** We say: &quot;a bucket of sand&quot; but not &quot;100 sands&quot;.
*'''Collective nouns''' are things that are the name of a group of things, like choirs, sets, and teams.
**A team is one group of people to play a game.  Two teams are two groups of people to play a game.
**A school is the building and all the people who go to the school or work at the school.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt; '''''Introduction to English''''' &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
'''English''' is one of the most important languages in the world. There are many reasons why English is so important. One of the reasons is that English is spoken as the first language in so many countries. There are 104 countries where English is spoken as the native language. 

Although English is the language of so many countries, more people in the world speak Mandarin Chinese as their first language. Mandarin Chinese is spoken in sixteen countries.  

Even in countries where English is not the native language, people use it for business and tourism. English is used for these purposes in most countries. English is considered the business language. English is the official language of the United Nations. English is also the official language of airlines and airports. All airline pilots that fly to other countries must be able to speak English. 

There are different kinds of English like British English, Canadian English and American English. These are not separate languages. They are dialects. A dialect is the way people in a particular place speak their native language. In one place, people might have a name they like to use for something that is not used in another place. For example: In Britain, they call the building where a motion picture is watched a cinema. In America, they call it a theater. This is just a different way of talking about the same thing. Both of the words cinema and theater are English words, and can be used to describe a building where motion pictures are watched, so both of these words are correct. It is important to remember that any form of English that you learn is good. There are no better versions of English. There are only different ones.

'''''Grammar''''' is the structure of a language, like its skeleton. It is important for language learners to understand the rules of grammar, because if you use or order words incorrectly, your sentences will not make sense. There are two methods of learning grammar - by using language or by learning the rules one by one and then applying them.  Most people use both methods together.

Grammar tells us how to put a sentence together and the order a sentence should have.  Different languages have different grammar.  People have studied English grammar for a long time.  Many of its rules have not changed for hundreds of years, but some rules are changing because the way people use English grammar is changing.

A '''proper noun''' is the name of a specific person, place, thing, animal, or idea. They are always capitalised ('''B'''ig '''L'''etters). Here are some examples:

*'''John''' went to school.
*The '''Great Pyramids''' are in '''Egypt'''.
*The '''United Nations''' is in '''New York City'''.
*My cat's name is '''Kate'''.

In English we don't usually use an article (a, an, the) with proper nouns.

A '''fish''' is an animal that has to spend all its time in the water. If it comes out of the water for too long of a time, it will die. A fish uses gills to get oxygen (air to breathe) from the water. Fish are usually covered with scales. One kind of fish is the shark. Some people keep fish as pets, and some people like to eat fish. 

Some fish live in fresh water (or sweet water), and some fish live in salt water. It is also possible for fish to live in water where a river runs into an ocean and the water mixes. This is called brackish water.

People eat many kinds of fish. The fish that people eat most include carp, cod, herring, perch, sardines, tilapia, trout, tuna, and many others. Some people keep fish as pets. Goldfish are a popular type of pet fish.

Most kinds of fish have bones. Some kinds of fish, such as sharks and rays, do not have real bones (their skeletons are made of cartilage). Some scientists say that these are not real fish, but most people call them fish. Some other animals that live in the sea, such as starfish and jellyfish, are called fish, but are not really fish.

The word to fish is also used for the activity of catching fish. People catch fish with small nets from the side of the water or from small boats, or with big nets from big boats. People can also catch fish with fishing poles and fishhooks with bait. This is often called fishing.

&lt;small&gt;Some of this page comes from the Wikipedia article on Fish&lt;/small&gt;

'''Birds''' are [[vertebrates]]. Their bodies have [[wikt:feather|feathers]], which keep them warm and waterproof. Birds usually have different kinds of feathers. One is for warmth and one is for waterproofing. Birds breathe oxygen. They usually eat fish, insects, worms and plants. There are birds on every continent of the world. Some birds do not fly but use their wings so they can move through the water. Some birds are so large that they are the same size as people. Some scientists believe dinosaurs [[w:evolution|evolved]] into birds.

Birds get their food in many ways. If they are trying to eat worms, they will [[wikt:peck|peck]] around at the ground until they find one or if they see one on the dirt, they will pick it up. Some birds like fish. To get fish to eat, they will land on the water if they see some fish, and then they will usually jab their neck and mouth under the water to try and bite the fish.

==Examples==
*Swan
*Penguin
*Flamingo
*Loon
*Hawk

There are more insects than any other creature in the world. For every person on this earth, there are hundreds or possibly thousands of insects. Insects are usually very small and easy to kill, but because there are so many of them, it would be difficult to kill them all.

Insects have probably been around longer than any other animal. They are called insects because they are divided into a head, a thorax and an abdomen. Insects always have six legs, which is why spiders are not insects. Insects have an exoskeleton instead of a regular skeleton, which means they are easy to destroy, but the exoskeleton keeps them relatively intact.

Insects usually live in giant colonies of themselves, although some of them, such as flies, do not. They start as maggots and later begin to fly. Insects usually eat leaves or other insects.

Throughout human history, people have been bothered by insects. Some insects are parasites who cause diseases and might even feed on human blood, like mosquitoes. This is why humans have developed various techniques for trying to destroy insects.

Some insects have been good for people. Bees help farmers by spreading flower pollen which makes more flowers.

==Examples==
*Cockroach
*Fly
*Ant
*Ladybug
*Butterfly

A '''subject''' is the main idea of a sentence.  It is usually made of a [[English/Parts of Speech/Nouns|noun]] or noun phrase.  It is what the sentence is about.
*For example: ''Phil is tall.''
:*&quot;Phil&quot; is the subject of the sentence.
:*&quot;Phil&quot; is a proper noun, the name of a person.
A sentence can also have more than one subject.
*For example: ''The man and his wife are moving to New York.''
:*This sentence has two subjects.
:*One subject is &quot;the man&quot;.
:*The other subject is &quot;his wife&quot;.
When a sentence has more than one subject, we call it a '''compound subject'''.

An '''adjective''' is a word that describes a [[wikt:noun|noun]] in a sentence.

Adjectives come in many types, including:
*Adjectives of [[wikt:quality|quality]]
*Adjectives of [[wikt:size|size]]
*Adjectives of [[wikt:color|color]]

'''Adjectives in English always come before the noun - a big house NOT &lt;strike&gt;a house big&lt;/strike&gt;.  Adjectives are always the same and never change for plural - 3 big houses NOT &lt;strike&gt;3 bigs houses&lt;/strike&gt;'''

Many regular adjectives (and [[English/Parts of Speech/Adverbs|adverbs]]) can be compared.  Learn more about this topic [[English/Parts of Speech/Adjectives/Comparatives and Superlatives|here]].

In addition to regular adjectives, there are two other types:
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Adjectives/Possessive Adjectives|Possessive adjectives]], that show who owns something (the object)
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Adjectives/Demonstrative Adjectives|Demonstrative adjectives]], that describe which thing

You may learn about these types of adjectives, go back to the last section about [[English/Parts of Speech/Verbs|verbs]], or go on to the next section about [[English/Parts of Speech/Adverbs|adverbs]].

Sentences come in two main parts:
*[[English/Parts of the Sentence/Subjects|Subjects]], that tell what the sentence is about
*[[English/Parts of the Sentence/Predicates|Predicates]], that describe the subject
These are the two main parts of every sentence.

You may learn about these parts of the sentence, go back to the previous section about [[English/Parts of Speech|parts of speech]], or go on to the next section about [[English/Word Functions|word functions]].

'''Mollusks''' are not members of the insect family, but many people think they are. Mollusks can be distinguished from insects by their lack of wings, and the fact that they are not warm-blooded. Although one might be tempted to be scared of mollusks, they are normally quite gentle and harmless. Mollusks have not been known to attack human beings in the wild or in captivity. To care for a mollusk, wash it ''gently'' and feed it small leaves or twigs. Most people do not recommend keeping mollusks as pets, however. A mollusk may or may not have a shell. This is not how you distinguish a mollusk; other animals have shells such as turtles. Nevertheless mollusks are often considered pesks, and are hunted in gardens and by small children.

The '''progressive tenses''' (or continuous tenses) are used to talk about things that are happening at that moment. A simple rule is:'''Past progressive''' is used to talk about things happening in the past and were not finished then. '''Present progressive''' is used to talk about things happening now. But more importantly, continuous tenses are used by speakers to organize information in certain ways that are in contrast to simple tenses. It is actually misleading to speak of a 'tense' since progressives are not primarily used to express past, present or future. Rather than expressing action in time they are used descriptively, to set the action in scene. For instance, when describing a photograph, the present continuous is used. In a story set in the past, actions expressed in the past progressive create a background for the real action, which is expressed in the simple past. Here is an example: &quot;I was walking in the park one day, when I ran into a friend.&quot; In the same way the'''Future progressive''' is used to describe a moment in the future. Here are some examples:

*I '''was driving''' to work at 8am this morning, the time the accident occured. (Past progressive)
*I '''am watching''' TV at the moment, could you come back later? (Present progressive)
*I '''will be eating''' dinner at 9pm this evening, so why don't you come at 9:30. (Future progressive)

'''Spelling''' is important when people write books or papers (or anything, really!) because if you [[w:spell|spell]] dog like &quot;dgo&quot;, people can't understand you.
Spelling is mainly typing or writing words correctly.

Spelling in English is very difficult because each letter of the alphabet has many different sounds.  There are many irregular spellings.  English also has a lot of foreign words and we don't usually change the spelling (unlike when other languages adopt foreign words) and there are often different spellings for words with the same pronunciation (e.g. there, their, they're)
== Examples of Misspellings ==
#heer--&gt; [[w:Here|Here]] or [[w:hear|hear]], depending on what word you're using.
#sentances--&gt; [[w:Sentences|Sentences]] (this is a common misspelling)
#acomodation --&gt; [[wikt:accommodation|accommodation]] this is the most common misspelling in English.
#alot --&gt; [[wikt:a lot|a lot]] this is a very common misspelling.  This can also be a misspelling for the word &quot;[[wikt:allot|allot]]&quot;.
#champane--&gt;[[wikt:Champagne|Champagne]]. (correct word )


== Double letters ==
Double letters can also be a problem when spelling English words because, unlike many languages, a double consonant doesn't change the pronunciation of a word.  Words like 'necessary', 'which' and 'accommodation' are the most commonly misspelled words for students of English as a foreign language.

{{English contents}}

Pronunciation describes '''how''' words and sentences are pronounced.  English is an international language so there is no one correct pronunciation of English.  Pronunciation of words is different between countries and also inside countries - pronunciation of words is very different in many parts of the [[w:United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] (See [[English/Differences between British English and American English|Differences between British and American English]])

English pronunciation is related to the history of English.  The two main roots of English are [[w:Anglo-Saxon|Anglo-Saxon]] (like German) and [[w:Latin|Latin]].  This means that most words in English sound a little like German or Latin.  Many short words come from Anglo-Saxon (good, but, wife) and have [[wikt:rough|rough]] sounds that are made in the [[w:throat|throat]].  Many long words come from Latin (provision, amiable, analysis) and have [[wikt:smooth|smooth]] sounds made by the [[w:tongue|tongue]] and [[w:lips|lips]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
Chess is not a game of luck or chance. The outcome depends on the choices of the players.

One player has white pieces and another player has black pieces. You can choice who gets a color by flipping a coin.

=== Order of play ===
After you put the pieces in the right place White makes the first move. White ''always'' makes the first move. After White has made their move, Black will then make a move. The game will go the same way until the end.

===General movement rules===
*A move is moving a single piece to an empty square on the board.
*If a piece is moved onto a square that has the other player's piece on it that piece is removed. That piece has been ''captured'' or ''taken''.
*The pieces can not jump over each other (except for ''the knight'').
*You can not make a move that puts your king in &quot;check&quot;.

== The Pieces ==
===King===
[[Image:Chess_kll44.png|left]]
The king can move one square at a time in any direction.

The king is the most important piece belonging to each player but isn't very powerful. If a king is about to be captured, that king is in ''check''. If a king is in ''check'' then it has to move out of check or another piece to block the check. A player can not move any other piece when they are in ''check'' unless it is to block the check.

If the king is placed in check and cannot escape, then it is in ''checkmate''. The first player to checkmate the the other player's king wins the game. Each player has one king. 

===Queen===
[[Image:Chess_qll44.png|left]]
The queen is the strongest piece, and can move in any direction. It can move left and right and up and down and diagonally. Each player has one queen. A queen is always on its colour.

===Bishop===
[[Image:Chess_bll44.png|left]]
The bishop can move any number of squares diagonally. Each player has two Bishops. An important thing about the Bishop is that it can only move on the same color squares.

===Rook===
[[Image:Chess_rll44.png|left]]
The rook can move left and right and up and down straight, but not, diagonally. The rook cannot jump over any pieces. If the rook takes the place of another piece, then it has ''captured'' it.

===Knight===
[[Image:Chess_nll44.png|left]]
The knight moves in a L-shaped. It moves two squares in one direction up or down or left and right and then one square perpendicular. The knight is the only piece that may jump over or move between other pieces. 

===Pawn===
[[Image:Chess_pll44.png|left]]
Pawns can move one square forward, or if the player wants to it can move two squares on its first move only. The pawn can move one square diagonally forward to capture a piece, but it can not capture pieces by moving straight forward. 

====Pawn Promotion====
If a pawn makes it to far edge of the board, the pawn is ''promoted''. A promoted pawn can be replaced with any other piece. For example, a player could get any other piece of his/her liking from pawn promotion.

Ancient China is a very old civilization. People wrote about the history of China 3500 years ago. China is one of the world's oldest continuous (still alive) civilizations. Turtle shells with ancient Chinese writing from the Shang Dynasty (商朝) have been carbon dated to about 1500 BC. These shells tell us that China began as city-states in the Yellow River valley. Many people say that China became an empire in 221 BC. The Qin (秦) emperor Qin Shi Huang made everyone write the same way. He also had ideas about the state which he based on legalism and fought Confucianism. This began what is called the Chinese civilization. Ancient China fought wars and Civil wars and was also sometimes conquered by other people.

==Geography==
The geography of China is different than the geography of the other ancient civilisations. It was a river valley civilisation, developing along the Huang He or &quot;Yellow&quot; river. The Yellow river was named for the yellow ''silt'', or rich soil at the bottom of rivers.

The climate of China varies geographically (changes based on place). In the far north during the winter, temperatures can reach to negative 50&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, and in the south the climate is tropical.

A '''predicate''' describes the [[English/Parts of the Sentence/Subjects|subject]] or tells what the subject does.  All [[English/Simple Sentences|sentences]] have predicates.  The predicate is usually the last part of a sentence.  It often starts with a [[English/Parts of Speech/Verbs|verb]].  Sometimes the verb is all of the predicate.

For example: The duck swims.
*&quot;The duck&quot; is the [[English/Parts of the Sentence/Subjects|subject]].
*&quot;swims&quot; is the predicate.
*&quot;swims&quot; is a verb.
*Because it is the verb that starts the predicate, we call it the ''main verb''.

Sometimes the verb is only the start of the predicate.  The predicate can also include [[English/Parts of Speech/Adjectives|adjectives]] or [[English/Parts of Speech/Adverbs|adverbs]] that change the verb.  It can include a [[English/Word Functions/Direct Objects|direct object]] that the subject acts on [[wikt:directly|directly]], or an [[English/Word Functions/Indirect Objects|indirect object]] that the subject acts on [[wikt:indirectly|indirectly]].  The predicate may include a [[English/Parts of Speech/Prepositions|preposition]] or two that explain more about the verb or other parts of the predicate.

You may go back to the page on [[English/Parts of the Sentence/Subjects|subjects]] as a part of the sentence, or forward to learn about [[English/Word Functions|word functions]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Articles''' are used with names.  In the next sentence the articles are '''bold''' and the names (or nouns) are in ''italics'': '''The''' ''time'' is {{CURRENTTIME}}. '''A''' ''purse'' would look nice with that.

There are two types of articles: definite and indefinite. ''A'' and ''an'' are indefinite articles. ''The'' is a definite article. Definite articles name one specific thing. &quot;''The'' pencil&quot; is talking about a certain pencil. &quot;''A'' pencil&quot; is talking about any pencil.

When talking about things for the first time, the indefinite article '''a''' is often used. Afterwards, the definite article '''the''' is used. For example:

&quot;There is '''a''' sofa and '''a''' table in my living room. '''The''' sofa is red and '''the''' table is made of glass.&quot;

A '''pronoun''' is a word that takes the place of a noun or refers to a noun in a sentence.

*The pronoun ''I'' is used to tell about yourself. For example, &quot;I like to dance.&quot; 
*The pronoun ''you'' is used to tell about another person or persons. For example, &quot;You are my friend&quot; or &quot;You are my friends.&quot; 
*English speakers use the pronoun ''he'' to tell about a boy or a man. An example is, &quot;He is at work.&quot; 
*The pronoun ''she'' is used to tell about a girl or a woman, as in &quot;She is an engineer.&quot; 
*''It'' is a pronoun used to tell about things. For example, &quot;The shirt is yellow. It has blue stripes.&quot; 
*The pronoun ''we'' is used when telling about yourself and other people, as in &quot;We are practicing our English.&quot; 
*''They'' tells about other people or things. &quot;They are at school&quot; or &quot;The cars are yellow. They are going fast.&quot; 
I, you, he, she, it, we and they are called subject pronouns because they tell who or what does the action in a sentence. They are used as subjects in a sentence.

An '''indirect object''' is a second object in a sentence.  It receives the action of the [[English/Parts of Speech/Verbs|verb]] only indirectly.  There can only be an indirect object if there is already a [[English/Word Functions/Direct Objects|direct object]].

''We gave the teacher our tests.''

In the above sentence ''we'' is the subject of the sentence, ''our tests'' is the direct object (the thing that was given), and ''the teacher'' is the indirect object.  This is because the teacher took the tests (receiving the action), but was not the thing given (our tests).

Indirect objects are often used in sentences with verbs like ''tell'', ''give'', ''ask'', ''buy'', 'sell'' and many other common verbs.

==Minor Scales==

===Introduction===
There are three kinds of minor scales, the natural minor, the harmonic minor, and the melodic minor.  Minor scales begin three notes before the major scale with the same key signature.  For example, A minor has the same keys signature as C major, B minor has the same key signature as D major.  Usually, a minor scale sounds sad.  The natural minor is the same thing as the aeolian mode.

'''Baseball''' is a ball game played with two teams of 9 players.  It is the &quot;National Pastime&quot; of the United States.

== Basics ==

You need a mitt and a bat. 

Currently, the Boston Red Sox are the World Series Champions, after they won against the Colorado Rockies in 4 games in a row.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Football''' is probably very popular because it doesn't require much. All you need is a ball and two markers for the posts. 

In a formal game there are two teams of 11 players. The duration of the game is 90 minutes. At half time (after 45 minutes), the teams change ends and there is an interval of 15 minutes. There is usually a little time added at the end of the halves; it is called ''Injury time''. At the end of the game, the team that scores the most goals (the number of times the ball goes in the goal) wins. In the case of a draw (when both teams have the same number of goals) there may be ''extra time'' (two 15 minute periods) or a ''penalty shoot-out''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are lots of different type or ''&quot;modes&quot;'' of '''Transport'''. Some of them go back several hundred years. Others are only fairly modern.

A '''conjunction''' is a word or phrase that unites (brings together) two or more things of the same type.  It may bring together [[English/Parts of Speech/Nouns|nouns]], [[English/Parts of Speech/Verbs|verbs]], [[English/Parts of Speech/Adjectives|adjectives]], [[English/Parts of Speech/Adverbs|adverbs]], [[English/Parts of Speech/Pronouns|pronouns]], [[English/Parts of Speech/Prepositions|prepositions]], [[English/Parts of Speech/Interjections|interjections]], phrases, or whole sentences.

For example:
''Bob and Jenny went to the bank.''

In this example, ''Bob'' and ''Jenny'' are [[English/Parts of Speech/Nouns/Proper Nouns|proper nouns]] (a kind of noun), and the word ''and'' joins them together, showing that both of them did the action (they both went to the bank).

==Kinds and Examples of Conjunctions==
There are two kinds of conjunctions: coordinating conjunctions and correlative conjunctions.  ''Coordinating conjunctions'' can work alone.  ''Correlative conjunctions'' work in pairs.

The most common coordinating conjunctions are: and, or, but, so, therefore, nor

The most common correlative conjunctions are: not only...but also, if...then, either...or, neither...nor

Sentences in English are made of...
* A [[English/Parts of the Sentence/Subjects|subject]] - the person, place, thing or idea the sentence is about
* And a [[English/Parts of the Sentence/Predicates|predicate]] - a [[wikt:word|word]] or [[wikt:phrase|phrase]] that tells about the subject.

In a sentence, the subject is first. The subject must be a [[wikt:noun|noun]] (a [[wikt:person|person]], [[wikt:place|place]], [[wikt:thing|thing]], or [[wikt:idea|idea]]), a [[wiktionary:pronoun|pronoun]] (a word that replaces a noun), or a phrase that describes one of those.  The subject is what the sentence is about.

After the subject comes the predicate.  The predicate is the rest of the sentence.  The predicate tells what the subject is or does.  It almost always begins with a [[English/Parts of Speech/Verbs|verb]] (an [[wikt:action|action]] or [[wikt:state of being|state of being]]).  It can be a verb alone.  When there is more than one verb in a sentence, we call the one at the beginning of the predicate the '''main verb'''.
*For example: ''He eats''.
:*&quot;he&quot; is the subject.
:*&quot;eats&quot; is the predicate.  
:*&quot;He&quot; is a pronoun.  
:*&quot;Eats&quot; is a verb. It tells what the subject (he) does.

Sentences often also include an [[English/Parts of the Sentence/Objects|object]] - a noun or phrase that the verb does something to.
*For example: ''He eats food''.
:*&quot;he&quot; is the subject.
:*&quot;eat food&quot; is the predicate.  
:*&quot;Eat&quot; is the verb, that tells what &quot;he&quot; does.  It is the first part of the predicate.  
:*&quot;Food&quot; is the rest of the predicate.  &quot;Food&quot; is a noun, the [[wikt:direct object|direct object]] of the verb.  
:*&quot;Food&quot; receives the action — food gets eaten.  
:*&quot;He&quot; (the subject) &quot;eats&quot; (the action) &quot;food&quot; (the direct object).

'''Complex sentences''' are sentences that usually contain multiple subjects and predicates connected by a subordinator such as ''after, although, as, as if, because, before, if, since, though, unless, when, where, whether, whereas, while'' and others. These sentences have an independent clause and [[a dependent clause]].  This is the first type of complex sentence containing an adverbial clause, a clause modifying the verb/action.
 
1. [[''When'' he tripped on the ice]]''',''' he dropped all his books and lost his homework.

2. The teacher lectured him [[''before'' she knew the reason why it was missing]]. 

3. The student explained the accident [[''because'' he was worried about his grade]].

4. [[''After'' he had explained the incident]]''',''' the teacher had mercy. 

'''Commas''' are used when the sentence starts with the dependent clause (e.g. sentence 1 and 4).  
No commas are necessary when the dependent clauses comes in the middle or end of the sentence (e.g. sentence 2 and 3).

There is another type of complex sentence in which the noun is being modified by [[an adjectival clause or relative clause]]. These complex sentences still contain multiple subjects and predicates which start with a subordinator such as ''which, that, who or whom'' just to name a few. 
 
A. The dog''',''' [[''which'' my brother petted on the way to school]]''',''' bit him.

B. The desk [[''that'' Peter sat on and fell]] is broken.

C. The box''',''' [[''which'' Samuel dragged into his backyard]]''',''' turned out to be full of toys.

D. The town [[''in which'' I live]] suffered from severe forest fires.
 
The comma rule is more subjective for relative clauses.  If the information in the clause is necessary for the information in the sentence, then the clause is set off by commas.  If the clause is not necessary for the sentence, then the cluase is surrounded by commas.

'''Parts of speech''' are ways to [[wikt:categorize|categorize]] words.  The category tells what the word does.  A [[English/Parts of Speech/Nouns|noun]], for example, names a person, a place, a thing, or an idea.  Here is a list of the parts of speech:
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Nouns|noun]]
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Verbs|verb]]
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Adjectives|adjective]]
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Adverbs|adverb]]
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Pronouns|pronoun]]
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Prepositions|preposition]]
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Conjunctions|conjunction]]
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Interjections|interjection]]

Another type of word that people often think of separately is the [[English/Parts of Speech/Articles|article]], but it is really a special kind of adjective.

A '''noun''' is a part of speech.  It names or [[wikt:identify|identifies]] four things:

*people
*places
*things
*ideas

Nouns can be categorized in many ways.
*They may be singular (like &quot;son&quot;) or plural (like &quot;sons&quot;).  This is called [[English/Parts of Speech/Nouns/Number|number]].
*They may be common (like &quot;house&quot;) or proper (like &quot;Thomas House&quot;).  All nouns that are not [[English/Parts of Speech/Nouns/Proper Nouns|proper]] are common.
*They may be concrete (like &quot;street&quot;) or abstract (like &quot;love&quot;).  All nouns that are not concrete are [[English/Parts of Speech/Nouns/Abstract Nouns|abstract]].
*They may be count (like &quot;piece&quot;), non-count or mass (like &quot;information&quot;) or collective (like &quot;group&quot;).  This is called [[English/Parts of Speech/Nouns/Countability|countability]].
*Some nouns may be masculine (like &quot;postman&quot;) or feminine (like &quot;stewardess&quot;), but most nouns do not have [[wikt:gender|gender]].  Nouns that are masculine or feminine are said to have [[English/Parts of Speech/Nouns/Gender|noun gender]].

You may learn about these aspects of nouns or go to the next section about [[English/Parts of Speech/Verbs|verbs]].

'''Countability''' is a very important idea about nouns.  Some other ideas depend on countability.  

*'''Count nouns''' are things that can be counted, like spoons, boys, and houses. 
**We can say one spoon, two boys, and three houses.
*'''Non-count nouns''' are things that can not be counted, but they can be measured.
** We say: &quot;a cup of milk&quot;, but not &quot;3 milks&quot;.
** We say: &quot;a pound of sugar&quot;, but not &quot;25 sugars&quot;.
** We say: &quot;a bucket of sand&quot; but not &quot;100 sands&quot;.
*'''Collective nouns''' are things that are the name of a group of things, like choirs, sets, and teams.
**A team is one group of people to play a game.  Two teams are two groups of people to play a game.
**A school is the building and all the people who go to the school or work at the school.

A '''proper noun''' is the name of a specific person, place, thing, animal, or idea. They are always capitalised ('''B'''ig '''L'''etters). Here are some examples:

*'''John''' went to school.
*The '''Great Pyramids''' are in '''Egypt'''.
*The '''United Nations''' is in '''New York City'''.
*My cat's name is '''Kate'''.

In English we don't usually use an article (a, an, the) with proper nouns.

A '''fish''' is an animal that has to spend all its time in the water. If it comes out of the water for too long of a time, it will die. A fish uses gills to get oxygen (air to breathe) from the water. Fish are usually covered with scales. One kind of fish is the shark. Some people keep fish as pets, and some people like to eat fish. 

Some fish live in fresh water (or sweet water), and some fish live in salt water. It is also possible for fish to live in water where a river runs into an ocean and the water mixes. This is called brackish water.

People eat many kinds of fish. The fish that people eat most include carp, cod, herring, perch, sardines, tilapia, trout, tuna, and many others. Some people keep fish as pets. Goldfish are a popular type of pet fish.

Most kinds of fish have bones. Some kinds of fish, such as sharks and rays, do not have real bones (their skeletons are made of cartilage). Some scientists say that these are not real fish, but most people call them fish. Some other animals that live in the sea, such as starfish and jellyfish, are called fish, but are not really fish.

The word to fish is also used for the activity of catching fish. People catch fish with small nets from the side of the water or from small boats, or with big nets from big boats. People can also catch fish with fishing poles and fishhooks with bait. This is often called fishing.

&lt;small&gt;Some of this page comes from the Wikipedia article on Fish&lt;/small&gt;

'''Birds''' are [[vertebrates]]. Their bodies have [[wikt:feather|feathers]], which keep them warm and waterproof. Birds usually have different kinds of feathers. One is for warmth and one is for waterproofing. Birds breathe oxygen. They usually eat fish, insects, worms and plants. There are birds on every continent of the world. Some birds do not fly but use their wings so they can move through the water. Some birds are so large that they are the same size as people. Some scientists believe dinosaurs [[w:evolution|evolved]] into birds.

Birds get their food in many ways. If they are trying to eat worms, they will [[wikt:peck|peck]] around at the ground until they find one or if they see one on the dirt, they will pick it up. Some birds like fish. To get fish to eat, they will land on the water if they see some fish, and then they will usually jab their neck and mouth under the water to try and bite the fish.

==Examples==
*Swan
*Penguin
*Flamingo
*Loon
*Hawk

There are more insects than any other creature in the world. For every person on this earth, there are hundreds or possibly thousands of insects. Insects are usually very small and easy to kill, but because there are so many of them, it would be difficult to kill them all.

Insects have probably been around longer than any other animal. They are called insects because they are divided into a head, a thorax and an abdomen. Insects always have six legs, which is why spiders are not insects. Insects have an exoskeleton instead of a regular skeleton, which means they are easy to destroy, but the exoskeleton keeps them relatively intact.

Insects usually live in giant colonies of themselves, although some of them, such as flies, do not. They start as maggots and later begin to fly. Insects usually eat leaves or other insects.

Throughout human history, people have been bothered by insects. Some insects are parasites who cause diseases and might even feed on human blood, like mosquitoes. This is why humans have developed various techniques for trying to destroy insects.

Some insects have been good for people. Bees help farmers by spreading flower pollen which makes more flowers.

==Examples==
*Cockroach
*Fly
*Ant
*Ladybug
*Butterfly

A '''subject''' is the main idea of a sentence.  It is usually made of a [[English/Parts of Speech/Nouns|noun]] or noun phrase.  It is what the sentence is about.
*For example: ''Phil is tall.''
:*&quot;Phil&quot; is the subject of the sentence.
:*&quot;Phil&quot; is a proper noun, the name of a person.
A sentence can also have more than one subject.
*For example: ''The man and his wife are moving to New York.''
:*This sentence has two subjects.
:*One subject is &quot;the man&quot;.
:*The other subject is &quot;his wife&quot;.
When a sentence has more than one subject, we call it a '''compound subject'''.

An '''adjective''' is a word that describes a [[wikt:noun|noun]] in a sentence.

Adjectives come in many types, including:
*Adjectives of [[wikt:quality|quality]]
*Adjectives of [[wikt:size|size]]
*Adjectives of [[wikt:color|color]]

'''Adjectives in English always come before the noun - a big house NOT &lt;strike&gt;a house big&lt;/strike&gt;.  Adjectives are always the same and never change for plural - 3 big houses NOT &lt;strike&gt;3 bigs houses&lt;/strike&gt;'''

Many regular adjectives (and [[English/Parts of Speech/Adverbs|adverbs]]) can be compared.  Learn more about this topic [[English/Parts of Speech/Adjectives/Comparatives and Superlatives|here]].

In addition to regular adjectives, there are two other types:
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Adjectives/Possessive Adjectives|Possessive adjectives]], that show who owns something (the object)
*[[English/Parts of Speech/Adjectives/Demonstrative Adjectives|Demonstrative adjectives]], that describe which thing

You may learn about these types of adjectives, go back to the last section about [[English/Parts of Speech/Verbs|verbs]], or go on to the next section about [[English/Parts of Speech/Adverbs|adverbs]].

These are the two main parts of every sentence.

'''Mollusks''' are not members of the insect family, but many people think they are. Mollusks can be distinguished from insects by their lack of wings, and the fact that they are not warm-blooded. Although one might be tempted to be scared of mollusks, they are normally quite gentle and harmless. Mollusks have not been known to attack human beings in the wild or in captivity. To care for a mollusk, wash it ''gently'' and feed it small leaves or twigs. Most people do not recommend keeping mollusks as pets, however. A mollusk may or may not have a shell. This is not how you distinguish a mollusk; other animals have shells such as turtles. Nevertheless mollusks are often considered pesks, and are hunted in gardens and by small children.

The '''progressive tenses''' (or continuous tenses) are used to talk about things that are happening at that moment. A simple rule is:'''Past progressive''' is used to talk about things happening in the past and were not finished then. '''Present progressive''' is used to talk about things happening now. But more importantly, continuous tenses are used by speakers to organize information in certain ways that are in contrast to simple tenses. It is actually misleading to speak of a 'tense' since progressives are not primarily used to express past, present or future. Rather than expressing action in time they are used descriptively, to set the action in scene. For instance, when describing a photograph, the present continuous is used. In a story set in the past, actions expressed in the past progressive create a background for the real action, which is expressed in the simple past. Here is an example: &quot;I was walking in the park one day, when I ran into a friend.&quot; In the same way the'''Future progressive''' is used to describe a moment in the future. Here are some examples:

*I '''was driving''' to work at 8am this morning, the time the accident occured. (Past progressive)
*I '''am watching''' TV at the moment, could you come back later? (Present progressive)
*I '''will be eating''' dinner at 9pm this evening, so why don't you come at 9:30. (Future progressive)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
Chess is not a game of luck or chance. The outcome depends on the choices of the players.

One player has white pieces and another player has black pieces. You can choice who gets a color by flipping a coin.

=== Order of play ===
After you put the pieces in the right place White makes the first move. White ''always'' makes the first move. After White has made their move, Black will then make a move. The game will go the same way until the end.

===General movement rules===
*A move is moving a single piece to an empty square on the board.
*If a piece is moved onto a square that has the other player's piece on it that piece is removed. That piece has been ''captured'' or ''taken''.
*The pieces can not jump over each other (except for ''the knight'').
*You can not make a move that puts your king in &quot;check&quot;.

== The Pieces ==
===King===
[[Image:Chess_kll44.png|left]]
The king can move one square at a time in any direction.

The king is the most important piece belonging to each player but isn't very powerful. If a king is about to be captured, that king is in ''check''. If a king is in ''check'' then it has to move out of check or another piece to block the check. A player can not move any other piece when they are in ''check'' unless it is to block the check.

If the king is placed in check and cannot escape, then it is in ''checkmate''. The first player to checkmate the the other player's king wins the game. Each player has one king. 

===Queen===
[[Image:Chess_qll44.png|left]]
The queen is the strongest piece, and can move in any direction. It can move left and right and up and down and diagonally. Each player has one queen. A queen is always on its colour.

===Bishop===
[[Image:Chess_bll44.png|left]]
The bishop can move any number of squares diagonally. Each player has two Bishops. An important thing about the Bishop is that it can only move on the same color squares.

===Rook===
[[Image:Chess_rll44.png|left]]
The rook can move left and right and up and down straight, but not, diagonally. The rook cannot jump over any pieces. If the rook takes the place of another piece, then it has ''captured'' it.

===Knight===
[[Image:Chess_nll44.png|left]]
The knight moves in a L-shaped. It moves two squares in one direction up or down or left and right and then one square perpendicular. The knight is the only piece that may jump over or move between other pieces. 

===Pawn===
[[Image:Chess_pll44.png|left]]
Pawns can move one square forward, or if the player wants to it can move two squares on its first move only. The pawn can move one square diagonally forward to capture a piece, but it can not capture pieces by moving straight forward. 

====Pawn Promotion====
If a pawn makes it to far edge of the board, the pawn is ''promoted''. A promoted pawn can be replaced with any other piece. For example, a player could get any other piece of his/her liking from pawn promotion.

Ancient China is a very old civilization. People wrote about the history of China 3500 years ago. China is one of the world's oldest continuous (still alive) civilizations. Turtle shells with ancient Chinese writing from the Shang Dynasty (商朝) have been carbon dated to about 1500 BC. These shells tell us that China began as city-states in the Yellow River valley. Many people say that China became an empire in 221 BC. The Qin (秦) emperor Qin Shi Huang made everyone write the same way. He also had ideas about the state which he based on legalism and fought Confucianism. This began what is called the Chinese civilization. Ancient China fought wars and Civil wars and was also sometimes conquered by other people.

==Geography==
The geography of China is different than the geography of the other ancient civilisations. It was a river valley civilisation, developing along the Huang He or &quot;Yellow&quot; river. The Yellow river was named for the yellow ''silt'', or rich soil at the bottom of rivers.

The climate of China varies geographically (changes based on place). In the far north during the winter, temperatures can reach to negative 50&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, and in the south the climate is tropical.

A '''predicate''' describes the [[English/Parts of the Sentence/Subjects|subject]] or tells what the subject does.  All [[English/Simple Sentences|sentences]] have predicates.  The predicate is usually the last part of a sentence.  It often starts with a [[English/Parts of Speech/Verbs|verb]].  Sometimes the verb is all of the predicate.

For example: The duck swims.
*&quot;The duck&quot; is the [[English/Parts of the Sentence/Subjects|subject]].
*&quot;swims&quot; is the predicate.
*&quot;swims&quot; is a verb.
*Because it is the verb that starts the predicate, we call it the ''main verb''.

Sometimes the verb is only the start of the predicate.  The predicate can also include [[English/Parts of Speech/Adjectives|adjectives]] or [[English/Parts of Speech/Adverbs|adverbs]] that change the verb.  It can include a [[English/Word Functions/Direct Objects|direct object]] that the subject acts on [[wikt:directly|directly]], or an [[English/Word Functions/Indirect Objects|indirect object]] that the subject acts on [[wikt:indirectly|indirectly]].  The predicate may include a [[English/Parts of Speech/Prepositions|preposition]] or two that explain more about the verb or other parts of the predicate.

You may go back to the page on [[English/Parts of the Sentence/Subjects|subjects]] as a part of the sentence, or forward to learn about [[English/Word Functions|word functions]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Articles''' are used with names.  In the next sentence the articles are '''bold''' and the names (or nouns) are in ''italics'': '''The''' ''time'' is {{CURRENTTIME}}. '''A''' ''purse'' would look nice with that.

There are two types of articles: definite and indefinite. ''A'' and ''an'' are indefinite articles. ''The'' is a definite article. Definite articles name one specific thing. &quot;''The'' pencil&quot; is talking about a certain pencil. &quot;''A'' pencil&quot; is talking about any pencil.

When talking about things for the first time, the indefinite article '''a''' is often used. Afterwards, the definite article '''the''' is used. For example:

&quot;There is '''a''' sofa and '''a''' table in my living room. '''The''' sofa is red and '''the''' table is made of glass.&quot;

A '''pronoun''' is a word that takes the place of a noun or refers to a noun in a sentence.

*The pronoun ''I'' is used to tell about yourself. For example, &quot;I like to dance.&quot; 
*The pronoun ''you'' is used to tell about another person or persons. For example, &quot;You are my friend&quot; or &quot;You are my friends.&quot; 
*English speakers use the pronoun ''he'' to tell about a boy or a man. An example is, &quot;He is at work.&quot; 
*The pronoun ''she'' is used to tell about a girl or a woman, as in &quot;She is an engineer.&quot; 
*''It'' is a pronoun used to tell about things. For example, &quot;The shirt is yellow. It has blue stripes.&quot; 
*The pronoun ''we'' is used when telling about yourself and other people, as in &quot;We are practicing our English.&quot; 
*''They'' tells about other people or things. &quot;They are at school&quot; or &quot;The cars are yellow. They are going fast.&quot; 
I, you, he, she, it, we and they are called subject pronouns because they tell who or what does the action in a sentence. They are used as subjects in a sentence.

An '''indirect object''' is a second object in a sentence.  It receives the action of the [[English/Parts of Speech/Verbs|verb]] only indirectly.  There can only be an indirect object if there is already a [[English/Word Functions/Direct Objects|direct object]].

''We gave the teacher our tests.''

In the above sentence ''we'' is the subject of the sentence, ''our tests'' is the direct object (the thing that was given), and ''the teacher'' is the indirect object.  This is because the teacher took the tests (receiving the action), but was not the thing given (our tests).

Indirect objects are often used in sentences with verbs like ''tell'', ''give'', ''ask'', ''buy'', 'sell'' and many other common verbs.

==Minor Scales==

===Introduction===
There are three kinds of minor scales, the natural minor, the harmonic minor, and the melodic minor.  Minor scales begin three notes before the major scale with the same key signature.  For example, A minor has the same keys signature as C major, B minor has the same key signature as D major.  Usually, a minor scale sounds sad.  The natural minor is the same thing as the aeolian mode.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Football''' is probably very popular because it doesn't require much. All you need is a ball and two markers for the posts. 

In a formal game there are two teams of 11 players. The duration of the game is 90 minutes. At half time (after 45 minutes), the teams change ends and there is an interval of 15 minutes. There is usually a little time added at the end of the halves; it is called ''Injury time''. At the end of the game, the team that scores the most goals (the number of times the ball goes in the goal) wins. In the case of a draw (when both teams have the same number of goals) there may be ''extra time'' (two 15 minute periods) or a ''penalty shoot-out''.

A '''conjunction''' is a word or phrase that unites (brings together) two or more things of the same type.  It may bring together [[English/Parts of Speech/Nouns|nouns]], [[English/Parts of Speech/Verbs|verbs]], [[English/Parts of Speech/Adjectives|adjectives]], [[English/Parts of Speech/Adverbs|adverbs]], [[English/Parts of Speech/Pronouns|pronouns]], [[English/Parts of Speech/Prepositions|prepositions]], [[English/Parts of Speech/Interjections|interjections]], phrases, or whole sentences.

For example:
''Bob and Jenny went to the bank.''

In this example, ''Bob'' and ''Jenny'' are [[English/Parts of Speech/Nouns/Proper Nouns|proper nouns]] (a kind of noun), and the word ''and'' joins them together, showing that both of them did the action (they both went to the bank).

==Kinds and Examples of Conjunctions==
There are two kinds of conjunctions: coordinating conjunctions and correlative conjunctions.  ''Coordinating conjunctions'' can work alone.  ''Correlative conjunctions'' work in pairs.

The most common coordinating conjunctions are: and, or, but, so, therefore, nor

The most common correlative conjunctions are: not only...but also, if...then, either...or, neither...nor
