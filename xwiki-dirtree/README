Directory tree runner.

This will take an XML file and convert it to a directory tree sutable for easy editing.
It will also take a directory tree and convert to an XML file.

To Build type:
mvn

To use:
cd ./target/
java -jar ./dir2xml.jar ../pom.xml
(notice a new directory /target/pom/)
java -jar ./dir2xml.jar ./pom/
(now there is a new file: /target/pom.xml)
You have converted an XML file to a dir tree and back.


How it works:
Converts tag names into filenames and inner content into file content.
Elements with child elements will be made into directorys.
Tag attributes will be output into a file inside the tag directory called &!attributes

<root attribute="value">
  <aTag>
    <anotherTag>Content</anotherTag>
  </aTag>
</root>

will produce:

root (directory)
 |
 +-&!attributes (file containing 'attribute="value"')
 |
 +-aTag (directory)
    |
    +-anotherTag (file containing 'Content')


What doesn't work:

<aTag>
  content
  <anotherTag>moreContent</anotherTag>
</aTag>
It will try to make aTag into a directory and seeing it has content will throw an error.

<aTag attribute="value">content</aTag>
Same problem.

- XML comments are not treated correctly.
- When converting an XML document to a dir tree and back, 
  order is mangled although the XML document remains the same.

Have fun!
