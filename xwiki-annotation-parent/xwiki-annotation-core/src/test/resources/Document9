# Test an annotation in which the last character is a punctuation sign.
# FIXME: in a very wrong way, the current algorithm ignores that last character considering the annotation to be ending 
# at the last alphanumeric character. This way, even if the annotation selection will contain it, it will not be 
# annotated.
